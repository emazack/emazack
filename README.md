- 👋 Hi, I’m @emazack
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-end, web development and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end: Typescript -> React. Secondly, I am building
solid foundations in computer science in order one day to be able to switch among programming languages and became a complete software developer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app creation
- 📫 How to reach me: em.zaccaria@gmail.com <-> https://github.com/emazack
